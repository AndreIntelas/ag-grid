title: "Grid Options"
---

All of these grid options are available through the generic `GridOptions<TData>` interface.

`TData` can optionally be used to represent the shape of the row data and is explained further under [Typescript Generics](/typescript-generics).

Properties marked as `Managed` can be updated via property bindings in frameworks, or by using one of the API functions [setGridOption](/grid-api/#reference-gridOptions-setGridOption) or [updateGridOptions](/grid-api/#reference-gridOptions-updateGridOptions).
