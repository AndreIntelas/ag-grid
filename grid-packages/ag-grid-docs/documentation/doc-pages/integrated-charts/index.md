With [AG Charts](https://charts.ag-grid.com/) at its core, Integrated Charts provides built-in charting that seamlessly
integrates with the grid, requiring minimal effort from developers.

## Built-In Charting

Just set `enableCharts=true` to [create charts](/integrated-charts-user-created/) from inside the grid.
