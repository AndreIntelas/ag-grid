AG Grid is an [open-source](https://github.com/ag-grid), framework agnostic, Javascript data grid with free [(Community)](../community-vs-enterprise#community) and lisenced [(Enterprise)](../community-vs-enterprise#enterprise) versions. To learn how to get started using the Grid, please read our [Installation Guide](../../get-started/installation).

## Overview

In its simplest form, AG Grid can be used to easily present your data in a table format, with all of the [features](../community-vs-enterprise#community) your users expect, such as: ___Filtering, Sorting, Pagination___, etc... available out-of-the-box:

- TODO: Add Basic Demo

Our Enterprise version comes with additional [advanced features](../community-vs-enterprise#enterprise), such as: ___Row Grouping, Aggregation, Pivoting, Advanced Filtering___, as well as dedicated support via [ZenDesk](https://ag-grid.zendesk.com/):

- TODO: Add Advanced Demo

### Why AG Grid?

Initially released in 2015, AG Grid has ammassed 11,000 stars on GitHub, with 2.2m downloads/month on NPM (and growing) making it one of the most popular JavaScript Grid libraries in the world.

## Features

AG Grid is extremely feature rich, but the features available to you will depend on which version of the Grid you're using. Read on for more information on the features available in each version, or browse our [Feature Comparison Matrix](../community-vs-enterprise#feature-comparison) for an exhaustive list.

### Enterprise Features

### Feature Comparison

## Lisencing

You do not require a lisence to start using AG Grid (including our Enterprise features), however, if you do use Enterprise features you will need to purchase a lisence before deploying to production. If you do not obtain a lisence, you will not be able to receive any support, the Grid will produce an error in the console and display a watermark over the Grid:

TODO: Add non-lisenced grid

### Pricing

Our enterprise lisences are priced based on the number of production applications & developer seats:

- Single Application licenses start at $999 per developer
- Multi Application lisenses start at $1,499 per developer.

Each licence is perpetual and comes with 1 year of ZenDesk support & 1 year of updates.
