title: "Adding Theme Builder exports to your application"
---

Key points:

1. The Theme Builder exports a CSS file that includes all styles required for the grid. Include this file in your page and do not include and other ag-grid CSS files or themes in the same page.
2. Follow the new application setup guide - https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/getting-started/ - as usual but include your Theme Builder download instead of `ag-grid.css` or `ag-theme-themename.css`.
3. This warning has been removed form the theme builder and should be put on this page instead in a way that's clear but doesn't overstate how much of an issue this will be. Note: we are working to remove this restriction, but themes exported from the Theme Builder are for the current grid version and will not be automatically updated with new features and bug fixes in later versions. If you upgrade your application's grid version and experience issues, return to the Theme Builder to download an updated version of your theme
