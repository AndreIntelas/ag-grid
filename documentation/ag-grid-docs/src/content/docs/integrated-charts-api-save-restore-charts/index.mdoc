This section shows how the Grid API can be used to save and restore charts.

## Saving / Restoring Charts

The example below demonstrates how you can save and then later restore a chart. You can make changes to the chart type, theme, data and formatting options and note how the restored chart looks the same as the chart that was saved.

* Change the chart type, theme, data and/or formatting in order to see the changes restored later.
* Click "Save chart" to persist a model of the visible chart into a local variable.
* Click "Clear chart" to destroy the existing chart.
* Click "Restore chart" to restore the previously saved chart.

## API Reference

A chart model that represent all the state information about the rendered charts can be obtained using `getChartModels()`. These models are returned in a format that can be easily used with the other API methods to later restore the chart.

{% apiDocumentation source="grid-api/api.json" section="charts" names=["getChartModels"] /%}

{% br /%}

{% interfaceDocumentation interfaceName="ChartModel" /%}

These models can then be supplied to the following grid api method to restore the charts:

{% apiDocumentation source="grid-api/api.json" section="charts" names=["restoreChart"] /%}

Note that an optional `chartContainer` can be specified when restoring a chart.
